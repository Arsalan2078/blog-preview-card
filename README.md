## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Custom CSS Library
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vite with React


### What I learned

This project has been a testing ground for my custom mini css library, which I intend to use for further projects.

The css library has flexbox and grid classes for many screen sizes, albeit only flexbox is used in this project. Additionally, it also has many classes for paddings, gaps, text-presets, colors, etc. These classes are used to layout and style the content of the blog cart.

The folder structure of the css library is based on the [7-1 Pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) to improve maintanability and clarity.

I also got more familiar working with figma files. Having direct access to variables like font sizes and spacers is very neat.
