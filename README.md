## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Custom CSS Library
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vite with React


### What I learned

This project has been a testing ground for my custom mini css library, which I intend to use for further projects.

The css library has flexbox and grid classes for many screen sizes, albeit only flexbox is used in this project. Additionally, it also has many classes for paddings, gaps, text-presets, colors, etc. These classes are used to layout and style the content of the blog cart.

The folder structure of the css library is based on the [7-1 Pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) to improve maintanability and clarity.

I also got more familiar working with figma files. Having direct access to variables like font sizes and spacers is very neat.
